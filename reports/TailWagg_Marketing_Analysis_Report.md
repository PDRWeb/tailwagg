## Project Information

### Project Brief

The Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of TailWagg — a leading retailer in the pet products industry, comparable to brands like Bark.co, Petco, and PetSmart — is seeking data-driven guidance to optimize holiday marketing efforts for the **Dog Products Division**.

To support this initiative, the analytics team conducted an in-depth review of the past **three years of sales and marketing performance data** across key dog product categories (e.g., treats, toys, grooming, accessories, wellness).

### Primary Goals

The primary goal is to identify dog products that:

- **Deliver strong profit margins**, supporting efficient campaign spend.
- **Show signs of mild performance decline or plateau**, indicating potential for reactivation through strategic promotion.
- **Have demonstrated historical uplift during seasonal events** (e.g., Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas gifting, National Dog Day, etc.).

### Strategic Focus Areas

Beyond product selection, the CMO is requesting **channel and execution strategy recommendations**, including:

- **Optimal marketing platforms by product type**, analyzing past engagement data across channels like Instagram Reels/TikTok (for toys and lifestyle products), email/SMS (for consumables like treats or food), and paid search or Amazon ads (for high-intent wellness purchases).
- **Campaign length and launch timing**, aligned with pet parent shopping behaviors — e.g., early-bird shoppers in late October vs. last-minute gifters in mid-December.
- **Cadence and messaging sequencing**, such as "pup gifting bundles," "stocking stuffers under $20," loyalty rewards pushes, or subscription upgrade promos.

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings Overview

Our findings identify specific product reactivation opportunities, seasonal performance patterns, and channel-specific recommendations to maximize ROI during the upcoming holiday season.

### 1. Product Performance Trend Classification

> **Data Source**: `notebooks/4.0-pdr-feature-engineering.ipynb` (Cells 5-7) - Rolling averages and trend calculations  
> **Analysis Method**: `notebooks/5.0-pdr-final-insights-visualization.ipynb` (Cells 3, 9) - Trend classification based on 30-day vs 90-day rolling average comparison

**Overall Product Portfolio Health:**

- **Plateau Products**: 45.5% (98,554 observations) - Stable performers maintaining consistent sales
- **Growing Products**: 28.0% (60,641 observations) - Products showing positive momentum
- **Declining Products**: 26.5% (57,230 observations) - Products requiring intervention

![Product Trend Distribution](figures/trend_distribution.png)
*Figure 1: Product performance trend classification across all 457 products over 3-year period*

**Key Insight**: More than one-quarter of our product portfolio is experiencing declining performance, representing significant reactivation opportunities for targeted holiday campaigns.

### 2. High-Margin Reactivation Targets

> **Data Source**: `notebooks/5.0-pdr-final-insights-visualization.ipynb` (Cells 3, 11) - High-margin declining products identification  
> **Calculation Method**: `notebooks/4.0-pdr-feature-engineering.ipynb` (Cell 3) - Net profit margin calculation: `(gross_profit / gross_revenue) * 100`

**Declining Products with Strong Profit Margins (>40%):**

Our analysis identified a critical subset of products that combine:

- Net profit margins exceeding 40%
- Recent sales decline based on 30-day vs. 90-day rolling average comparison
- Historical performance demonstrating market viability

![High-Margin Declining Products](figures/high_margin_declining.png)
*Figure 2: Scatter plot showing declining products with >40% profit margins (priority reactivation targets)*

These products represent the **highest-priority targets** for holiday reactivation campaigns, as they offer:

- **Strong profit contribution** per unit sold
- **Proven market demand** (historical sales data)
- **Lower customer acquisition risk** (existing awareness)
- **Maximum ROI potential** from marketing spend

**Strategic Recommendation**: Focus 60-70% of holiday marketing budget on reactivating these high-margin declining products rather than pushing already-growing items.

### 3. Category Performance Analysis

> **Data Source**: `notebooks/3.0-pdr-product-performance-analysis.ipynb` (Cells 5-6) - Category and product aggregation  
> **Analysis Period**: October 2022 - October 2025 (3 years)

**Revenue and Profit Leaders:**

| Category | Total Revenue | Total Profit | Unique Products | Avg. Margin |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Accessories** | $3,872,742 | $822,094 | 98 | 21.2% |
| **Grooming** | $3,309,911 | $697,120 | 84 | 21.1% |
| **Wellness** | $2,948,344 | $623,731 | 83 | 21.2% |

| **Treats** | $899,060 | $188,971 | 86 | 21.0% |

![Category Performance](figures/category_performance.png)
*Figure 3: Category performance comparison - revenue, profit, and margins across all 5 product categories*

**Key Insights**:

- Accessories, Grooming, and Wellness categories drive the highest absolute profit
- All categories maintain consistent profit margins (~21%), indicating healthy pricing strategies
- Toys category has the most products (106) but generates less revenue per product
- Treats category is underperforming despite having 86 unique SKUs

### 4. Seasonal Event Performance

> **Data Source**: `notebooks/2.0-pdr-calendar-events-analysis.ipynb` (Cells 1-5) - Calendar event flagging and categorization  
> **Event Framework**: Federal holidays (US), Major retail events, Pet industry celebrations

**Calendar Event Analysis:**

- **20 unique seasonal events** tracked across federal holidays, major retail events, and pet industry celebrations
- **191 total seasonal event days** (including 2-day pre-holiday periods)
- **Event Categories**: Federal Holidays (44 days), Pet Industry Events (20 days), Major Retail Events (varying)

![Seasonal Event Performance](figures/seasonal_performance.png)
*Figure 4: Top 10 seasonal events ranked by average gross profit per transaction*

**Seasonal Performance Patterns:**

The analysis reveals significant sales uplift correlation with specific event types:

1. **Major Retail Events** (Black Friday, Cyber Monday)
   - Highest gross profit concentration
   - Peak shopping volume
   - Multi-category engagement

2. **Pet Industry Events** (National Dog Day, National Pet Day, Take Your Dog to Work Day)
   - Strong performance in Toys and Treats categories
   - High engagement with lifestyle/gift products
   - Opportunity for themed bundles

3. **Federal Holidays** (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Independence Day)
   - Sustained performance across all categories
   - Extended shopping windows (2-day pre-holiday lift observed)
   - Gift-oriented purchase behavior

**Pre-Holiday Shopping Behavior:**
Analysis of 2-day pre-holiday periods shows measurable sales increases, indicating that pet parents plan purchases in advance of major events. This validates the importance of **early campaign launches** to capture pre-holiday demand.

### 5. Promotional Responsiveness

> **Data Source**: `notebooks/5.0-pdr-final-insights-visualization.ipynb` (Cells 3, 15) - Promotional uplift analysis  
> **Methodology**: Comparison of average sales between promotional vs non-promotional periods

**Promotional Impact Analysis:**

- Products with active promotions show an estimated **15% uplift** in sales
- 130,988 transactions (60.5%) occurred with promotional support
- 85,437 transactions (39.5%) were organic (non-promotional)

![Promotional Impact](figures/promotional_impact.png)
*Figure 5: Promotional impact comparison showing revenue lift and uplift percentage by category*

**Key Finding**: Promotions drive significant volume but should be strategically deployed on:

- High-margin declining products (to reactivate demand)
- Seasonal event periods (to amplify existing uplift)
- Plateau products (to test growth potential)

**Warning**: Avoid over-promoting already-growing products, as this erodes profit margins without generating incremental demand.

## Deep Dive Analysis

### Product Reactivation Opportunities

> **Primary Analysis**: `notebooks/5.0-pdr-final-insights-visualization.ipynb` (Cells 9-11)  
> **Supporting Data**: `notebooks/4.0-pdr-feature-engineering.ipynb` (Cells 5-7) - Feature engineering for trends

#### A. Declining High-Margin Products: The Priority List

**Strategic Context:**

Our trend analysis identified products where recent 30-day average sales are falling below their 90-day average, combined with net profit margins exceeding 40%. These products represent the **sweet spot** for holiday reactivation campaigns:

- **Lower reactivation risk**: Historical data proves market demand exists
- **Higher profit contribution**: Each unit sold generates 2x the portfolio average margin
- **Marketing efficiency**: Existing brand awareness reduces acquisition costs
- **Quick wins**: Declining products respond well to targeted promotional nudges

#### B. Reactivation Strategy Framework

**1. Product Selection Criteria**

Target products that meet ALL of the following:

- Net profit margin > 40%
- 30-day avg sales < 0.95 × 90-day avg sales (declining trend)
- 90-day average sales > 1 unit (minimum viable demand)
- Historical seasonal uplift (event responsiveness)

**2. Campaign Timing Strategy**

> **Analysis Basis**: `notebooks/2.0-pdr-calendar-events-analysis.ipynb` (Cell 4) - Pre-holiday shopping behavior (2-day lead time analysis)

Based on pre-holiday shopping behavior analysis:

| Campaign Phase | Timing | Target Products | Channel Strategy |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Early Bird** | Late October | High-ticket Accessories, Wellness | Email/SMS to loyalty members |
| **Pre-Thanksgiving** | Early November | Grooming, Toys bundles | Paid Social (Instagram/TikTok) |

| **Holiday Gifting** | Dec 1-20 | Toys, Treats gift sets | Amazon Ads, Paid Search |
| **Last Minute** | Dec 21-23 | Digital products, Quick-ship items | Search + Email urgency |

**3. Promotional Depth Recommendations**

| Margin Tier | Discount Ceiling | Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| 40-50% margin | 15-20% off | Moderate discount to maintain 30%+ net margin |
| 50-60% margin | 20-25% off | Aggressive discount for volume |
| 60%+ margin | 25-30% off | Deep discount for clearance/reactivation |

**4. Messaging & Bundle Strategy**

**For Declining High-Margin Products:**

- **Accessories** (Declining): "Holiday essentials for your pup" - position as gift-giving must-haves
  - Bundle strategy: Collar + Leash + ID Tag bundles
  - Channel: Instagram Stories/Reels showcasing lifestyle imagery
  
- **Grooming** (Declining): "Get your dog holiday-ready" - tie to seasonal events and family gatherings

#### C. Expected Impact

**Conservative Projections** (based on 15% promotional uplift × declining product volume):

- **Reactivation of 26.5% declining product portfolio**
